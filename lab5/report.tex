\section{Performance on Provided Examples}

%% Results showing the time taken (with a cut off) and number calculated for your implementations on the provided test data.

%% Discussion of the reults making it clear you know which algorithms managed to terminate before being killed and whether they calculated the correct answer.

%% If an algorithm was killed, note whether it provided a ''best answer so far''

%% For algorithms that either terminated with an incorrect answer or were killed but gave a best so far answer how close were they to the correct answer?  You can express this as ``found a value that was at least 85% of the best possible value''.  If more than one algorithm returns an incorrect (or best so far) answer which got closer to the correct answer?

\section{Recommendation}

%% Make a recommendation for which algorithm the airline should use for problems of size 500-2000 of similar type to the hard instances in the supplied data.  What should the airline do if the algorithm doesn't terminate within their desired time limit?

\appendix

%% Any raw data or code scripts you want to present should be included as appendices.
